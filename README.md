## Brief Description

Blindness makes life rather difficult for people who suffer from this health problem, but the use of technology can help in some day-to-day tasks. In this context, the present work focuses the development of a photo-to-speech application for the blind. Intelligent Eye, as the name suggests, is a technical remedy for the visually impaired so that they can navigate themselves with their own self without external assistance. Ideology behind this project is to strike an impact on the society so that visually backward beings can equalise their status. In this project, we combined both image and text processing to build a useful deep learning application.
